									<h3 class="major">Why Showcase Projects</h3>
									<p>Projects serve as the crucible within which theoretical knowledge is tempered by practical experience, a fundamental component in the maturation of any engineer. They act as tangible demonstrations of our ability to navigate the complexities of design, problem-solving, and innovation. Each project, whether it culminates in success or offers valuable lessons from its shortcomings, contributes significantly to our professional growth. They allow us to manifest our ideas into physical realities, offering a canvas to showcase our skills, creativity, and adaptability to challenges. Moreover, projects encourage collaborative teamwork, resilience in the face of unexpected obstacles, and the continual application of emerging technologies. In essence, they are not just milestones of learning but also stepping stones towards the pinnacle of engineering expertise.</p>
