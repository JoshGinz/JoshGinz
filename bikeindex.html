                    <h2>Work In Progress </h2>

                    <h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The primary objective of the Wooden Bike Frame Challenge, a key component of the Statics course at the University of Delaware, was to design and build a functional and safe wooden frame bike, specifically a "balance bike" similar to the historical "Dandy Horse". This project not only aimed to revitalize the tradition of mechanical engineering in bike design but also to showcase the innovative maker skills of the students. The end product was expected to be a full-scale prototype, foot-propelled, and capable of supporting an adult user. This task was not just about building a bike; it was about merging historical design with modern engineering techniques, emphasizing creativity, practical skills, and technical knowledge.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>The project's requirements were stringent and multifaceted, focusing on both the design process and the final product. Key requirements included:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p><strong> Material and Construction Constraints </strong> : The bike frame had to be constructed entirely from 1/2" thick plywood, using a limited amount of 1/4-20 hardware. The major frame pieces had to be cut from a single 4 ft x 4 ft plywood sheet using a CNC router, with manual carpentry allowing for minor modifications.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong> Integration and Safety </strong> : The incorporation of a pre-fabricated front steering column and 26" wheels was mandatory. The bike had to safely support a 200 lb user with a Factor of Safety (FOS) of 1.5.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong> Portability and Functionality </strong> : The design had to ensure that the bike could be disassembled to fit into a standard travel bike bag, with no brakes or drive systems, being purely foot-propelled.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong> Cost-Effectiveness and Aesthetics </strong> : The design needed to be economical, lightweight, easy to assemble, comfortable, stylish, and fast, meeting various user-centric priorities.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

												<p>CAD software was instrumental in visualizing and refining our bike design, allowing for precise modeling of the frame, integration of the front steering column, and accommodation of the 26" wheels. The ability to import models of standard hardware and create detailed engineering drawings and assembly instructions streamlined the design process, ensuring accuracy and feasibility. Furthermore, the static analysis was crucial in validating the structural integrity of the bike. This involved rigorous calculations to ensure the bike frame met the required Factor of Safety (FOS) of 1.5, a key measure to guarantee that the frame could safely support a 200 lb user. This process not only solidified my understanding of structural analysis principles but also honed my skills in applying theoretical concepts to practical, real-world scenarios. The integration of CAD and static analysis thus provided a comprehensive approach to designing a bike that was not only functional and safe but also adhered to the aesthetic and practical requirements of the project.</p>

										<h3>Engineering Calculations</h3>

										<p>For Potential Failure #1 at the seat plate connection, the analysis shows the reactions at a pin support with the loads on the pin being Ax equal to 0, Ay at 300 lb, and a moment Am of 7107 lb/inch. The minimum Factor of Safety (FOS) calculated for this connection is 2.97, indicating a strong capacity to withstand applied loads and additional unexpected loads nearly three times higher than the maximum anticipated force without failing, which speaks to the conservative and safe design approach.</p>
										<p>Potential Failure #2 relates to the front fork connection. The images reveal the loads on this pin to be Bx at 0, By at -537.08 lb, and a bending moment Bm of -14524.9 lb*inch. Here, the FOS is calculated to be 1.33, which while lower than the seat plate connection, still meets the design requirement of an FOS greater than 1. This ensures that the front fork can safely carry the expected loads plus a 33% margin for unexpected stresses.</p>
										<p>These calculations are central to the design validation process, ensuring that the bike frame will be safe for use. The careful consideration of static loads and moments, along with the application of factors of safety, underlines the meticulous application of statics principles in engineering design, essential for a successful project outcome.</p>
